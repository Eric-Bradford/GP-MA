# Gaussian process modifier adaptation
The code in this repository is based on the works in [[1]](#1)[[2]](#2) and is written in Matlab. It is a variation of a modifier adapation algorithm using Gaussian processes (GP-MA). To cite GP-MA please use the publications [[1]](#1)[[2]](#2).

## Getting started
Download the entire folder containing all Matlab files and add the entire folder and subfolders to the Matlab path. Next run [RTO_MA_GP](/RTO_MA_GP.m), which should run the pre-defined problem as defined in [[2]](#2). Once this works the "true" plant model can be modified in [Plant_model](Plant_model.m) with the corresponding objective defined in [Plant_data](Plant_data.m). The "approximate" plant model can be modified in [Approx_model](Approx_model.m) with the corresponding approximate objective defined in [Approx_data](Approx_data.m). Note the plotting only works for two dimensional problems.
